* mx.sh
- needs a way to get A and AAAA addresses of MX records
  - one problem is that I think I need the domain in order to the nmap scripts to work
  - unless there is a way to pass the domain name to the script
- otherwise a way to get MX domains
  - that have ipv4
  - that have ipv6
- a way to expire the scanning that is NOT the old file?
  - a file might be enough if git saved
